/** 
 *  FLAW{LESS} Css Framework

 *  Starter Page
 *  This is an example page that shows many of the possibilities
 *	you have by using the FLAW{LESS} Css Framework. The base layout
 *	is divided into 8 columns (in this example) for all devices.
 *	Through media queries the columns change position and width
 *	if viewed with smaller screen sizes.

/* Here we import the framework. Note that this does not
 * add any styles yet. We are using the less.js framework
 * which adds variables and mixins (behave like function calls)
 * This way the framework can provide infinite features, without
 * adding anything more than you need on your website.

/* ================== SETUP THE FRAMEWORK  ==================
 * Here you can see the basic three setup variables that most
 * websites will need to set in order to use the framework.
 *
 * it is also important to set up those vars here so that all
 * imported .less files you create build upon this foundation
 */

/* The vertical rhythm is used to give your webpages a consistent
 * look. The whole grid system relies on this value to calculate
 * gaps, spans and so on. Basically this defines the row-height of
 * the grid in pixels and aligns all elements in the flow of the grid. 
 */

/* Here you can control the overall font size. Not that this value 
 * strongly correlates with the vertical rhythm. If you make these
 * two values too different your text flow will look ugly
